<br>
<p>Juan Estela is currently a sophomore studying Graphic Design at the School of Visual Arts at Boston University. Before heading to Boston for a higher education, Juan was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago. It wasn't until his time at Highland Park High School that he developed a love for design, photo, and time-based media. His passion for the disciplines inspired him to pursue an education and career in the arts.</p>
<p>Juan has designed numerous logos for various organizations, ranging from school organizations to local businesses, as well as designing promotional content for others. As a photographer, Juan has most experience in shooting Cross Country & Track meets, but also shoots portraits and sometimes street photography. In his spare time, Juan learned to use video-editing software such as Sony Vegas, Premiere Pro, and After Effects, and he has applied his knowledge of these tools in various filmmaking classes, as well as in personal projects. He hopes to seek more opportunities to integrate his video-editing abilities into his design work.</p>
